### **What are WhatsApp Triggers:**

WhatsApp Triggers on  Voxloud are predefined words or phrases that initiate specific actions within a bot conversation. They serve as powerful entry points for restarting conversations, initiating live chats, managing subscriptions and unsubscriptions, and launching specific bot flows. These triggers are also used to define **Ice Breakers** (starter messages users can tap) and **Command Prompts** (typed phrases that trigger specific workflows or bot behaviors). By simply messaging the bot with a trigger word, users can seamlessly navigate to desired actions, making the chatbot more interactive, intuitive, and automation-friendly.

### **Benefits of WhatsApp Triggers:**

- **Initiate Conversations Easily**: Triggers let users start or restart specific conversations without navigating menus.
- **Enable Smart Automation**: Trigger words can launch flows or features instantly, improving user experience and efficiency.
- **Simplify Bot Navigation**: Ice Breakers and Command Prompts reduce friction by offering clickable or typable shortcuts to actions.
- **Streamline Subscription Management**: Words like "start" or "stop" help automate opt-ins and opt-outs for campaigns or updates.

3. You will be presented with 4 cards, each designed for different purposes:
   - Bot Triggers
   - Chat Flow Triggers
   - Chatbot Ice Breaker
   - Chatbot Commands

### **Section B: Using Bot Triggers:**

You can define the specific words or phrases that act as commands to control key chat actions. These include:

- **Restart Chatflow Triggers**: Set keywords (e.g., “restart”, “begin again”) that reset the conversation and take the user back to the bot’s starting point.
- **Live Chat Triggers**: Assign words (e.g., “agent”, “help”) that instantly connect the user to a human agent for real-time support.
- **Subscribe/Unsubscribe Triggers**: Configure terms (e.g., “start”, “stop”) to automate user opt-ins and opt-outs from marketing flows or broadcasts.

### **Section C: Using Chat Flow Triggers:**

Configure keywords to automatically initiate specific chatflows based on user messages. Two flexible matching options are available:

- **Exact Match**: The chatflow is triggered only when the user's message exactly matches the configured keyword (e.g., user types just “pricing”).
- **Contains Match**: The chatflow is triggered if the keyword appears anywhere in the user’s message (e.g., “Can you share pricing details?” triggers the “pricing” flow).

### **Section D: Using Chatbot Ice Breaker:**

Ice Breakers are ready-made message options that show up when someone opens your WhatsApp chatbot for the first time. When a user taps on one, it can start a specific chatbot flow in  Voxloud.

- Enter the prompt of the Ice Breaker.
- Select the chatflow to be started when the above Ice Breaker is chosen.

### **Section E: Using Chatbot Commands:**

Commands let users type a `/` followed by a keyword in the WhatsApp chat to trigger specific bot actions. These commands help users quickly restart a chat, start a live chat, subscribe or unsubscribe, or even trigger a chatflow. They make the chatbot experience faster, smarter, and more interactive—especially for repeat users.

**How to set up Commands:**

- **Enter a Command Name:** This is the word the user will type after `/` (e.g., `/help`).
- **Add a Description:** Give a short explanation of what the command does.
- **Select the Trigger Action:** Choose what action the command should perform—restart chat, start live chat, subscribe/unsubscribe, or run a chatflow.
