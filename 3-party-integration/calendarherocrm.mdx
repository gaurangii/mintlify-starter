As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from

Voxloud to the CalendarHero’s \*\*Name \*\*field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to CalendatHero fields.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between Voxloud and **CalendarHero**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the CalendarHero you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to CalendarHero, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
