to map **parameters (fields) of Google Task** to the user response of the  Voxloud question.

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?

Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from

Voxloud to the Google Task’s Name field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Google Task fields.

### **Step 4 of 4: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the Google Task you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Google Task, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
