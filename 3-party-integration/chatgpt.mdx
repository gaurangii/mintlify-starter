### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are getting blank responses or undesired responses :

- **Wrong Authorization Details-** You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials, such as API Token, API key, and/or URL, have been entered correctly.
- **Free plan-** You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud or ChatGPT, as integration works only in the paid plan.
- **Training Data-** The training data you provided was ineffective or inept.
