1. Now enter the API key, and click the ‘Connect’ Button to complete integration of  Voxloud with SendInBlue.
2. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says, “**Integrated.”**

### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

1. Now, as the connection of the  Voxloud and SendInBlue is established, you need to map **parameters (fields) of SendInBlue** to the user response of the  Voxloud question/queries.

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question from Bot questions/components: Please provide your name?

Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from  Voxloud to the SendInBlue App’s \*\*Name \*\*field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to SendInBlue App fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

1. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says, “**Mapped successfully.”**

   c. Also, your SendInBlue CRM integration will show the message \*\*Installed \*\*in the

   Integration List.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between \*\* Voxloud\*\* and **SendInBlue** and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the SendInBlue that you have integrated.

### **Still Not working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to CRM, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Token, API key, URLMetc has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and 3rd App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
