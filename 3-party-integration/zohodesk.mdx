### **Step 3 of 3: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between Voxloud and **Zoho Desk**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the Zoho Desk you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Zoho Desk, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Domain added- You will be required to check and see if you have selected the Domain URL correctly.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
