You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard and the Flowlu you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy leads from your Bot to Flowlu, it may be due to multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You need to check and see if all the authorization credentials, such as API Token, API key, and URL, have been entered correctly.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud, as integration works only with the paid plan.
