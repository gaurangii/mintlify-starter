with SupportBee CRM. Click on the ‘Integrate tab.’

b. The Integrate Window Will Open up. Select the ‘All Integrations’ Tab.

c. A list of all native integrations for  Voxloud will be available in this window.

d. Now find SupportBee CRM by:-

- Either by scrolling down the list or,
- by typing **‘SupportBee CRM’** in the Search Box with the placeholder “Search Integration By Name”

e. Now Click On The **‘Connect’** Button As Shown

f. An Interface, as shown below, will open up. Here, you will be asked to enter the APi key

that you will get by logging into your SupportBee account.

### **Step 2 of 5: Find your Authorization Key/Token in App Account**

a. To get the API key, login to the SupportBee account.

b. Click on the profile on the top left-side of the dashboard and them click on API Token

c. Copy the API Token

### **Step 3 of 5: Enter Authorization Details and establish connection with your App**

a. Enter SupportBee APi key and click the ‘Connect’ Button to complete integration of

Voxloud with SupportBee.

b. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says,

“**Integrated Successfully.”**

### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

a. Now, as connection of the  Voxloud and SupportBee is established, you need

to map **parameters (fields) of SupportBee** to the user response of the  Voxloud question.

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?

Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from

Voxloud to the SupportBee Name field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to SupportBee fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

b. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says,

“**Mapping successfully.”**

c. Also, your SupportBee integration will show the message Installed in the Integration

List.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between Voxloud and **SupportBee**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the SupportBee that you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to SupportBee, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
