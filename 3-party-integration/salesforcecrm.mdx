For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name. Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from  Voxloud to the Salesforce CRM’s **Name **field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Salesforce CRM fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto-fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

Click the ‘Test Lead’ tab to test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your Salesforce CRM that you have integrated.

**Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy leads from your Bot to Salesforce CRM, it may be due to multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Domain, Client ID and Client Secret have been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
