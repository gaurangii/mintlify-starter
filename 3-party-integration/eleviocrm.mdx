   - Access Tokenthat you will get by logging into your Elevio account.

### **Step 2 of 5: Find your Authorization Key/Token in App Account**

2. Scroll down the page . In case there is no API Key listed, you can click on ‘Create API Key’ tab to create one. Enter a ‘Description’ e.g. ‘New API Key’ or ‘API Key for  Voxloud’.
3. Click on one of the option and ‘Generate API Key’
4. Your API Key label will be listed at the bottom of the page. Click on ‘View Key & Token’ and copy your Elevio API Key and Access Token.

1. Enter Elevio API key and Access Token, and click the ‘Connect’ Button to complete integration of  Voxloud with Elevio CRM.
2. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says, “**Integrated Successfully.”**

### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

1. Now, as connection of the  Voxloud and Elevio is established, you need to map **parameters (fields) of Elevio** to the user response of the  Voxloud question. You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

   For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?. Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

   As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from  Voxloud to the Elevio’s \*\*Name \*\*field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Elevio fields.

<Info>
  The queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

2. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says, “**Mapping successfully.**
3. Also, your Elevio CRM integration will show the message \*\*Installed \*\*in the Integration List.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between \*\* Voxloud\*\* and **Elevio**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the Elevio you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Elevio, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
