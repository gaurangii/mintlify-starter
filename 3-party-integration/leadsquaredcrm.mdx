to map **parameters (fields) of LeadSquared** to the user response of the  Voxloud question.

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?

Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from

Voxloud to the Lead Squared’s Name field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to LeadSquared fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

“**Mapping successfully.**

List.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between  Voxloud and **LeadSquared**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the LeadSquared you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to LeadSquared, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
