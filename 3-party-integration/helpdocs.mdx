### **Step 2 of 5: Find your Authorization Key/Token in App Account**

1. To complete the process, you need to fill out:-
   - The API Token
2. **\
   The API Token:-**
   - Click The settings button, under your profile icon on your Helpdocs dashboard.
3. \
   Here, navigate to the API Tab.
4. Now, you need to create an API Key. Click on the ‘Create Key’ button.
5. \
   It will generate an API Key. The name of the first key you generate will be “Unnamed.”
6. \
   Click on the three dots icon and click on edit to configure your API Key. Now, a separate window will appear.
7. \
   Here you can rename your API Key. Also, toggle the read and write permissions for your API Key.
8. Moreover, copy your API Key from here to paste it into your  Voxloud Account.
9. \
   After Making Changes, click on Save Changes.

### **Step 3 of 5: Enter Authorization Details and establish connection with your App**

1. After filling out the API key, click Connect.
2. \
   Look for the notification “Integrated Successfully” for confirmation.
3. \
   Also, your HelpDocs integration will show the message **Installed **in the Integration List.

### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

1. Now, as the connection of the  Voxloud and **HelpDocs** is established, you need to map the **parameters (fields) of HelpDocs **to the user response of the  Voxloud question.
2. \
   You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.
   - For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?
   - Then, you map it with the parameter -Name.
   - As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from
   -  Voxloud to the Infobip’s **Name **field in the leads. Similarly, for integration to work correctly, you must map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Infobip fields.
   - Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So make sure you configure your chat flow first.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between ** Voxloud** and **HelpDocs** and complete the mapping, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard and in the HelpDocs you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to HelpDocs, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Token, API key,and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and HelpDocs parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
