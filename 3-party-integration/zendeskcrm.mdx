f. An Interface, as shown below, will open up. Here, you will be asked to enter

- APi Token
- Email Address
- APi URL

that you will get by login to your Zendesk account.

### **Step 2 of 5: Find your Authorization Key/Token in App Account**

a. Click on ‘Admin’  tab on the left side of the Zendesk dashboard, you will find your

API URL on the top-right corner. Now click on **‘Go to Admin Center’** to get your API Token.

b. Go to Apps and Integrations\>Zendesk API. If you don’t have an Active API Token list,

click **‘Add API Token’** to create one.

c. Add a Label to your API Token and copy the code

d. Save your API Token and it will be listed in the Active API Token list

### **Step 3 of 5: Enter Authorization Details and establish connection with your App**

a. Enter Zendesk API Token, API URL and Email Address registered with Zendesk, and

click the ‘Connect’ Button to complete integration of  Voxloud with Zendesk.

b. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says,

“**Integrated Successfully.”**

### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

a. Now, as connection of the  Voxloud and Zendesk is established, you need

to map **parameters (fields) of Zendesk** to the user response of the  Voxloud question.

You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.

For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?

Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from

Voxloud to the Zendesk’s Name field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Zendesk fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

b. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says,

“**Mapping successfully.**

c. Also, your Zendesk CRM integration will show the message installed in the Integration

List.

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between Voxloud and **Zendesk**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard as well as in the Zendesk you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Zendesk, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as API Token, API key, and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and App parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
