### **Integrate  Voxloud with Groove:-**

### **Step 1 of 5: Login to  Voxloud Account and Select Application to Integrate**

1. Login to your  Voxloud account, and select the Bot you want to integrate with Groove.
2. Now, click the**‘Integrate’ tab.** 
3. \
   The Integrate window will open up. Make sure you are in the **“All Integrations Tab.”**
4. A list of all native integrations for  Voxloud will be available in this window.
   - Now find Groove by:-
   - Either scrolling down the list
   - Or by typing in **‘**Groove**’** in the search box with the placeholder “search integration by name”
5. Now click on the ‘**connect’** button as shown below.

### **Step 2 of 5: Find your Authorization Key/Token in App Account**

1. To complete the process, you need to fill out:-
   - The API Token
2. **The API Token:-**
   - Click the Settings button (the gear icon), on the left-most side of Your Groove dashboard.
   - \
     Here, click on the company tab.
   - Now, navigate to the ‘Webhooks & API’ button.
3. \
   Under the ‘Webhooks & API’ button, Click on the API button.
4. \
   Copy the API token under the Global Token Tab and paste it on  Voxloud.

### **Step 3 of 5: Enter Authorization Details and establish connection with your App**

1. After filling out the API Key, Click Connect.
2. Look for the notification “Integrated Successfully” for confirmation.
3. \
   Also, your Groove integration will show the message **Installed **in the Integration List.

### **Step 4 of 5: Set up Mapping Parameters**

1. Now, as the connection of the  Voxloud and Groove is established, you need to map the **parameters (fields) of **Groove to the user response of the  Voxloud question.
2. You can use the **\+Add Parameters** button to add more fields.
   1. For example, you select a question from All bot questions/components: Please provide your name?
   2. Then, you map it with the parameter -Name.
   3. As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from
   4.  Voxloud to the Infobip’s **Name **field in the leads. Similarly, for integration to work correctly, you must map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Infobip fields.
   5. Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So make sure you configure your chat flow first.
   6. \
      If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says, “**Mapping successfully.**

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between ** Voxloud** and **Groove **and complete the mapping, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard and in the Groove you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Groove, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Token, API key,and/or URL has been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and Jira CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in paid plan.
