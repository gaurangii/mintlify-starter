Then, you map it with the parameter -Name

As a result, this mapping will enable integration to send the user's response from  Voxloud to the Charkra CRM’s **Name **field in the leads. Similarly, in order for integration to work properly, you will require to map all other questions/ components of your Bot to Chakra CRM fields.

Please note that these queries/questions options will be auto fetched from your bot chat flow, So, make sure you configure your chat flow first.

c. If you have entered all the details correctly, you will see a notification that says “**Mapping successfully.”**

### **Step 5 of 5: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between ** Voxloud** and **Chakra CRM**, and the mapping is complete, you are ready to go for your first test lead. Click the ‘Test Lead’ tab to test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your Chakra CRM that you have integrated.

**Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy leads from your Bot to Chakra CRM, it may be due to multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret have been entered correctly.
- Wrong Mapping Set up - Your mapping with  Voxloud Question and CRM parameter is either incorrect or you haven’t added any mandatory parameter.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only in the paid plan.
