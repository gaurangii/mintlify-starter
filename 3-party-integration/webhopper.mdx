### **Step 4 of 4: Test your Integration Set up with Data**

Once you have established a connection between ** Voxloud** and **WebHoper** and complete the mapping, you are ready to go for your first test lead. You can test your integration setup by creating a dummy lead on the bot. This lead should appear in your  Voxloud dashboard and in the WebHoper you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy leads from your Bot to **WebHoper**, it may be due to multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials are accurate. Kindly check credentials like:
- Webhoper Domain
- Company Name
- Lead Source
- Division
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  Voxloud as integration works only with the paid plan.
