With the option to create multiple flows in your website chatbot, you can easily connect different flows using the redirect component. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

## **How to create a trigger flow:**

1. **Create a New Flow**:

2. **Set Up Redirect in a Previous Flow**:
   - Go to the existing flow where you want to trigger the new flow.
   - Add the "Redirect" chat component (as shown in the screenshot).

3. **Flow Redirection**:
   - Once set, the bot will automatically redirect to the selected flow when the redirect component is triggered within the conversation.

This allows you to seamlessly connect multiple flows within one chatbot, enhancing the flexibility of your chat interactions on the website.
