## **What are Webhooks?**

A **webhook** is a way for one app to automatically send data to another app when something happens. Instead of checking for updates all the time, the receiving app gives a special URL, and the sending app sends information to that URL as soon as the event occurs. This helps automate tasks, keep data updated in real-time, and connect different systems without manual work.
