## **Step 1: Logging In**

To begin using the live chat functionality, the agent must first be added as a member by the admin. The admin will provide the necessary credentials.

**Note : If you haven‚Äôt received them, please contact the admin to get access.**

As soon as you log in to the page, you'll see the **"Go Online"** button on the left-hand side. You can enable or disable this button based on whether you want to be available for live chat.

- **Status** - The Status of each chat is a key feature for both individual agents and teams to track the current state of each conversation. It helps to ensure that no chat is left unattended or missed.

    You can mark status to particular chat from the dropdown or can create a new one as depicted in the screenshot below.

- **Tags** - Tags are used to assign a specific label or category to a chat, helping agents and team members quickly identify the topic or nature of the conversation. By assigning tags, you can "stamp" a chat with relevant information, making it easier to understand the context.

You can assign tags to particular chat from the dropdown or can create a new one as depicted in the screenshot below.

### **Step 4:  Filtering Chats in the Inbox**

To make it easier to manage and prioritize chats, we have a **Filters** section in the inbox. You can filter out chats based on various criteria, such as:

- **Date & Time:** Filter chats by the date and time they were received.
- **Tags:** Choose specific tags to view chats related to particular categories, such as product inquiries, support, or sales.
- **Status:** Filter chats based on their status (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved).
- **Assigned Agent:** Filter chats to see those assigned to a specific team member.

This filtering functionality allows you to quickly narrow down and focus on specific chats that need attention, ensuring better organization and workflow.
