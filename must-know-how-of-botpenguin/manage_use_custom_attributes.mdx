## **Custom Attributes**

Custom Attributes in  Voxloud are user-defined properties or variables that can be assigned to individual users within your chatbot platform. These attributes enable you to capture and store specific information about users, which they share during chat or can be accessed from external databases. Custom Attributes are a powerful tool for personalizing interactions and creating tailored experiences for users in your chatbot.

## **Types of Custom Attributes**

There are primarily two types of custom Attributes

1. Custom Attributes whose values are being defined by the answers given by users in the chat flow.
2. Custom Attributes whose values are being defined using the external API for any user.

## **Primary Usage**

Custom Attributes can be used for the following use cases

1. Personalize user interactions
