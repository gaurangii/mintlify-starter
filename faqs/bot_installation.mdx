  <Accordion title="How to resolve latency issues on my website when I have the chatbot installed">
    We understand the criticality of website speed and responsiveness. Adding a trigger delay only delays the chatbot from opening, but the script of the chatbot is loaded at the same time as the page, which can delay the overall page loading and create latency issues. This happens because of the vast processes that allow chatbots to run smoothly. However, this problem can be solved.

    In the document ready function, create a timeout function of 3sec. In that timeout function, create a script element with the details of the script shared while installing the chatbot.

    ```
    <script>
        const scriptEle = document.createElement("script");
        scriptEle.src = ('src', 'https://cdn. Cube6.com/ Cube6.js');
        scriptEle.setAttribute('id', ' Cube6-messenger-widget');
        scriptEle.innerHTML = '[Your Bot ID]';
    
        document.onreadystatechange = function () {
          if (document.readyState == "complete") {
            setTimeout(() => {
              document.body.appendChild(scriptEle);
            }, 3000);
          }
        }
      </script>
    ```

    \*\*Please note: \*\*Do not forget to replace `[Your Bot ID]` with you bot ID that you can find in your script.
