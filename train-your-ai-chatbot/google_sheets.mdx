### **FAQ's:**

Here are some common FAQ's regarding Google Sheets:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What kinds of Google Sheets are supported for training?">
    Only public or shared sheets with proper access permissions (viewer or editor) can be synced. Ensure your sheet isn't restricted or private.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My Google Sheets has multiple tabs. Will the bot train on all of them?">
    Currently, the system typically trains on the **first tab** of the sheet. For multi-tab training, ensure relevant data is consolidated in a single tab.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What format should the sheet follow for best result?">
    Use a two-column format: one for **Questions** and one for **Answers**. Avoid using formulas, merged cells, or complex formatting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why was I redirected to another page while connecting to Google Sheets?">
    That’s a normal part of the **OAuth authentication process** for Google account access. After signing in, return to the "Google Sheets" tab to complete the sync.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I clicked SYNC GOOGLE SHEETS but nothing seems to happen. What should I do?">
    Refresh the page, ensure the sheet URL is correct and publicly accessible, and confirm you are logged into the correct Google account.
  </Accordion>

    After syncing the first sheet, simply click the **"Sync Google Sheet"** button again (top-left corner) to repeat the process for additional sheets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will the bot automatically update when I make the changes to the sheet later?">
    No, you need to **manually resync** the sheet after any edits to reflect the updates in your chatbot training.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete or disconnect a synced sheet later?">
    Yes. Visit the connected sheets section and select the one you wish to remove or update. The training data will adjust accordingly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I entered the correct sheet URL but it is not syncing. What could be wrong?">
    Double-check the sheet’s **sharing settings** and make sure it's not restricted. Also, confirm that you've completed the Google sign-in process correctly.
